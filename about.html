        <h3>Hello, I am Vaibhavi.</h3>
        <p>
            I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech) at Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli. My journey into the world of programming began in my first year of college when I started working with languages like C/C++. I am an active participant on platforms like CodeChef and have a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as well as other core computer science subjects. I enjoy solving problems on platforms like LeetCode.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have gained proficiency in various programming languages and have successfully completed several projects using the MERN stack. Currently, I am diving into the world of mobile app development by learning Flutter and Dart for my mini-project.
        </p>
        <p>
        While I may not consider myself a master in every aspect, I am genuinely enthusiastic about further expanding my expertise in these areas. I eagerly welcome opportunities to continue learning and growing in the field of computer science and programming. I am confident in my ability to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
